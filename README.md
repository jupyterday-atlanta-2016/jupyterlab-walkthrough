# JupyterLab Walkthrough

Talk given at Jupyter Days Atlanta, Aug 13, 2016.

The audience should get a tour of the latest features of JupyterLab. The audience should learn about the intended path of JupyterLab development and how third party extensions will be added. 
There is no knowledge requirement, but experience with the existing Jupyter Notebook would be beneficial. The preferred duration would be 25 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions.
